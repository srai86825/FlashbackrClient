# FlashBackr Frontend Client App

Welcome to the FlashBackr frontend client application repository! This repository contains the codebase for the frontend of the FlashBackr social media platform.

## Introduction

FlashBackr is a dynamic social media platform built on the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The frontend client app is responsible for providing an interactive user interface, facilitating user interactions, and displaying content from the server-side application.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the FlashBackr frontend client app locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd flashbackr-client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Environment Variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Define environment variables such as API base URL, Google API key, etc.

4. **Start the Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Features

- **React.js Framework:** FlashBackr's frontend is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React.js enables component-based development, state management, and efficient rendering.

- **Material-UI Components:** FlashBackr utilizes Material-UI, a set of React components that implement Google's Material Design, to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface. Material-UI components enhance usability and accessibility.

- **Client-Side Routing:** FlashBackr implements client-side routing using React Router to enable navigation within the application without full page reloads. Client-side routing provides a seamless browsing experience.

- **State Management with Redux:** FlashBackr uses Redux, a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, to manage application state and facilitate data flow between components. Redux ensures consistency and scalability in managing complex application state.

- **Authentication Mechanisms:** FlashBackr integrates Google and email authentication mechanisms to securely authenticate users and manage user sessions. Tokens and sessions are used to authenticate and authorize user actions.
